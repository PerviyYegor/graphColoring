# graphColoring
C# program based on WinForms that allows you to enter a graph, calculate the chromatic number and color the graph using the greedy coloring algorithm.

My task was to develop a Dekstop application in C # in the .NET framework for Windows, the purpose of which is to determine the chromatic number of a graph 
whose number of vertices is less than or equal to 20 and the number of edges should not exceed 50, and visualization of graph work, that is, I had to calculate 
how many colors are needed to color the vertices of the graph so that adjacent vertices do not repeat each other's color. The graph must also be oriented and 
presented in MFI format. An oriented graph is a graph D that consists of a finite set V of vertices and a set of ordered pairs of different vertices. 
Any such pair (u, v) is called an arc or an oriented edge and is usually denoted by uv.
